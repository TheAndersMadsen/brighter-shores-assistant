{"title":"Coarse Hickory Log","content":"Coarse Hickory Log is an item obtained from a Hickory Tree using the Woodcutter profession; with a Woodcutter level of 6 and a Hatchet. It is used to make Coarse Hickory Poles for the Carpenter profession by processing them into Coarse Hickory Posts with the Circular Saw then followed by refining them a second time using the Lathe found in the Carpenter's Workshop. When gathered, it yields 95 Woodcutter experience and 135 total Carpenter experience when fully processed (67 experience with the saw and a further 35*2 with the lathe). Like all other logs, each log will yield 2 posts when processed.\n\n\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Coarse_Hickory_Log","last_modified":"2024-11-13T01:27:50Z","categories":["Category:Items","Category:Needs variant","Category:Pages with update history"]}
