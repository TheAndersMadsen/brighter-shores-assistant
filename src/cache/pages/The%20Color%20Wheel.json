{"title":"The Color Wheel","content":"The Color Wheel is a room where players can dye their armor. In order to access this mechanic, the player will need to advance the Spider's Nest quest to the stage in which they acquire the Tar Rat (requires 32 Carpenter). This will give access to the Pool of Rainbows room, containing a node to collect rainbow water in a bucket.\n\nThere are 20 different dyes available in The Color Wheel. Collecting and using 1 bucket of rainbow water on Iridiana grants access to them all, however each bucket grants only 10 uses.\n\nOnce unlocked, the player can use an item on the dye tub of choice to dye their armor.\n\n\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/The_Color_Wheel","last_modified":"2024-11-13T01:49:05Z","categories":["Category:Pages with update history","Category:Rooms","Category:Stubs"]}
