{"title":"Fire Toad","content":"Fire Toads are a category of monster. They are found in caves. The Hopeport town guard fights fire toads regularly, to the point where it might at first glance be mistaken that that is all they do.\n\nBeing that players first enter the game as members of the Hopeport town guard, it is anticipated that fighting Fire Toads will be one of the most common ways that players initially improve their combat abilities.\n\nAs their name implies, Fire Toads attack with fire, which is a long-range attack with a constant speed, independent of distance to target. Fire Toads can use their fire attack every 2.5 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n * Fire Toads were the first named monsters to be presented to players, in the original trailer for the game.\n\n","tables":[[{"Location":{"text":"Strange Junction"},"Levels":{"text":"6, 24, 73, 119, 164, 239, 356"},"Zone":{"text":"3","number":3},"Maplink":{"text":""}},{"Location":{"text":"Outside Hollow"},"Levels":{"text":"6, 24, 73, 119, 164, 239, 356"},"Zone":{"text":"3","number":3},"Maplink":{"text":""}}]],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Fire_Toad","last_modified":"2024-11-11T23:17:10Z","categories":["Category:Pages with update history","Category:Variant categories"]}
