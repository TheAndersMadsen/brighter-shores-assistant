{"title":"Placid Bass (skill node)","content":"Placid Bass\n\nThe Placid Bass can be caught solo or co-op with another player. It is 165xp per catch solo and 202xp per catch using the co-op method. It is less click intensive than the eel/puffer method.\n\nThe respawn rates are faster than most fish at around 30 seconds, thus you can catch each of the three fishing spots, run back and they will respawn right after.\n\n\n\n\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Placid_Bass_(skill_node)","last_modified":"2024-11-11T07:56:45Z","categories":["Category:Pages with update history","Category:Skill nodes","Category:Stubs"]}
