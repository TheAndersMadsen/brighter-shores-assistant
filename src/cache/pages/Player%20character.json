{"title":"Player character","content":"Player characters are human-controlled characters in Brighter Shores. They have the ability to explore the world, train professions, pick a class, and more.\n\nPlayer characters can access all free-to-play areas in the game, but their parent account owning a Premium Pass will allow them to access more content. After picking an appearance for the character with the design your character interface, players define their name with the name your character interface, which is suffixed with a hash and a number (e.g. Name#566). The number is always the smallest positive integer not used by anyone with the selected name. Free-to-play player characters cannot change their character name after creation, but Premium Pass owners are able to set a unique character name (without a suffix) and can change their name at any time.\n\nNew player characters start in Captain Degreene's Office with the design your character interface open.","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Player_character","last_modified":"2024-11-11T22:36:26Z","categories":["Category:Community","Category:Mechanics"]}
