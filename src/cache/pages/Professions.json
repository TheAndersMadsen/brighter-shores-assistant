{"title":"Professions","content":"Professions are skills that player characters can train and utilize throughout Brighter Shores. Players can gain experience to advance their profession level either by actively playing the game, or passively while the game is closed. Unlocking a new episode also unlocks a new set of professions, which can typically only be trained within that episode.\n\nAs the name suggests, most professions can be used as a way to earn money, though they have a variety of other uses, including fulfilling quest requirements, gathering resources to use in other professions, or processing raw materials into items. Each episode also has one combat profession, the training of which allows players to attack new varieties of monsters and wield higher level weapons and armour in its respective episode.\n\nPlayers can continue to perform certain profession-related activities while logged out of the game. Activities eligible for passive training are marked with a moon icon. Passive methods are unlocked by spending knowledge after reaching the required level for that activity.\n\nThe amount of time one can spend training passively is limited to 24 hours, or by the number of input items in the player's backpack (usually one hour per item).\n\nPassive methods scale down in experience rates the higher your level gets above the method you are doing. For example, the level 25 AFK method for Carpentry (making stools) returns 1950xp per hour at Carpentry level 25, and 950xp per hour at Carpentry level 30. More data is required to fully test this impact, but you should always aim to use the latest passive method you have unlocked to avoid losing experience.\n\n\n\nNote: Knowledge Points will always provide the player with 25% (1/4) of the base experience needed to level up at that current level. This will also scale with each level the player gains.\n\nThe following table shows the relationship between the profession level, the experience required for that level, and the experience difference from the previous level:\n\n\n\n\n * Profession capes\n * Skill node\n\n","tables":[[{"episode":{"text":"1","number":1},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Unlocks higher level monsters and gear"}},{"episode":{"text":"1","number":1},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Cooking food items","links":[{"text":"food","type":"internal","page":"food"}]}},{"episode":{"text":"1","number":1},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Catching various fish","links":[{"text":"fish","type":"internal","page":"fish"}]}},{"episode":{"text":"1","number":1},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Gathering items"}},{"episode":{"text":"1","number":1},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Brewing potions","links":[{"text":"potions","type":"internal","page":"potion"}]}},{"episode":{"text":"2","number":2},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Unlocks higher level monsters and gear"}},{"episode":{"text":"2","number":2},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Gathering Items for Combination potions"}},{"episode":{"text":"2","number":2},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Chopping down trees","links":[{"text":"trees","type":"internal","page":"tree"}]}},{"episode":{"text":"2","number":2},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Create planks from logs"}},{"episode":{"text":"3","number":3},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Unlocks higher level monsters and gear"}},{"episode":{"text":"3","number":3},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Creates melee weapons, ranged weapons, and shields specific to Guardian.","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Guardian"}]}},{"episode":{"text":"3","number":3},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Mining minerals","links":[{"text":"minerals","type":"internal","page":"mineral"}]}},{"episode":{"text":"3","number":3},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Creates melee weapons, ranged weapons, and shields specific to Cryoknight.","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Cryoknight"}]}},{"episode":{"text":"3","number":3},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Creates melee weapons, ranged weapons, and shields specific to Hammermage.","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Hammermage"}]}},{"episode":{"text":"4","number":4},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Unlocks higher level monsters and gear"}},{"episode":{"text":"4","number":4},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Complete Bounties"}},{"episode":{"text":"4","number":4},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Use hide to create leather"}},{"episode":{"text":"4","number":4},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Merchant stall logistics trading items between stalls"}},{"episode":{"text":"5","number":5},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Unlocks higher level monsters and gear"}},{"episode":{"text":"5","number":5},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Build ???"}},{"episode":{"text":"5","number":5},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""},"col4":{"text":"Creates armor"}},{"episode":{"text":"5","number":5},"col2":{"text":""},"name":{"text":""}}]],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Professions","last_modified":"2024-11-12T20:01:35Z","categories":["Category:Mechanics","Category:Pages with update history","Category:Professions"]}
