{"title":"Health","content":"Health (also known as \"HP\") represent a player or monster's health. If it reaches zero, the player or monster will die. Health increases with the player or monsters respective 'combat' profession level.\n\nBrighter Shores features varied damage types and sources. The main source of damage currently is Monsters.\n\nWhile fighting, the player and their opponent have a bar over them. This bar represents Health.\n\nThe bar has two sections, one pale green and one dark red. The pale green shows how much health is left and the red shows how much damage has been taken.\n\n\n\nAt the end of a fight the player will recover all of their health.\n\nDuring a fight the player will heal health very slowly, so the damage being dealt to you is often misleading in terms of how well you are doing in a fight.\n\nThe player can also heal with health potions, these come in some variants: Whilst potions are useful for healing 99% of the time, at lower levels the amount of time it takes to heal with a potion can be too long, restoring less health than is dealt to you, especially with a 10% potion.\n\nDying will heal 100% of your health.","tables":[[{"col1":{"text":"Impact damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Impact","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Impact"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Cryonae damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Cryonae","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Cryonae"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Arborae damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Arborae","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Arborae"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Hammermage icon.svg"},"col2":{"text":"Tempestae","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Tempestae"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Infernae damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Infernae","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Infernae"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Necrotic damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Necromae","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Necromae"}]}}],[{"col1":{"text":"Beady-eyed Deathcrow.png"},"col2":{"text":"Monsters","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Monsters"}]}}],[{"col1":{"text":"10%25_Potion_Healing.png"},"col2":{"text":"10% Potion","links":[{"text":"10% Potion","type":"internal","page":"10% Potion Healing"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"20%25_Potion_Healing.png"},"col2":{"text":"20% Potion","links":[{"text":"20% Potion","type":"internal","page":"20% Potion Healing"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"20%25_Potion_Healing.png"},"col2":{"text":"25% Potion","links":[{"text":"25% Potion","type":"internal","page":"25% Potion Healing"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Health_potion.png"},"col2":{"text":"28% Potent Potion","links":[{"text":"28% Potent Potion","type":"internal","page":"28% Potent Potion"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"20%25_Potion_Healing.png"},"col2":{"text":"32% Potion","links":[{"text":"32% Potion","type":"internal","page":"32% Potion"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Health_potion.png"},"col2":{"text":"35% Potent Potion","links":[{"text":"35% Potent Potion","type":"internal","page":"35% Potent Potion"}]}}]],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Health","last_modified":"2024-11-11T18:03:05Z","categories":[]}
