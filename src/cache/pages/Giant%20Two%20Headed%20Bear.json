{"title":"Giant Two Headed Bear","content":"Giant Two Headed Bear is a Boss monster. Slain during Main Story to get access to the Glowing Bee Hive to extract Glowing Honey.\n\nNote. The model takes two blocks of space; you can \"safespot\" the boss monster by standing at the far end of the narrow cave entrance on the west side of the map. This is a good opportunity to drink potions, avoid his slam attack and return when you can. The southern most tile of the bridge can also be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Giant_Two_Headed_Bear","last_modified":"2024-11-11T00:16:03Z","categories":["Category:Monsters","Category:Needs aggressiveness","Category:Needs variant","Category:Pages with update history"]}
