{"title":"Damage","content":"Damage is what is used to describe a monster's and/or player's attacks from their combat actions. Damage is split into different types and is possibly determined by the player's weapon. A weapon can also have no damage type.\n\n\n\nWhile fighting, the player and their opponent have a bar over them. This bar represents Health.\n\nThe bar has two sections, one pale green and one dark red. The pale green shows how much health is left and the red shows how much damage has been taken.\n\n\n\nAt the end of a fight the player will recover all of their health.\n\nDuring a fight the player will heal health very slowly, so the damage being dealt to you is often misleading in terms of how well you are doing in a fight.\n\nThe player can also heal with health potions, these come in some variants: Whilst potions are useful for healing 99% of the time, at lower levels the amount of time it takes to heal with a potion can be too long, restoring less health than is dealt to you, especially with a 10% potion.\n\nDying will heal 100% of your health.","tables":[[{"col1":{"text":"Impact damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Impact","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Impact"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Cryonae_damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Cryonae","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Cryonae"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Arborae_damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Arborae","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Arborae"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Tempestae_damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Tempestae","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Tempestae"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Infernae damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Infernae","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Infernae"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Necromae damage icon.png"},"col2":{"text":"Necromae","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Necromae"}]}}],[{"col1":{"text":"10% Potion Healing.png"},"col2":{"text":"10% Potion","links":[{"text":"10% Potion","type":"internal","page":"10% Potion Healing"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"20% Potion Healing.png"},"col2":{"text":"20% Potion","links":[{"text":"20% Potion","type":"internal","page":"20% Potion Healing"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"20% Potion Healing.png"},"col2":{"text":"25% Potion","links":[{"text":"25% Potion","type":"internal","page":"25% Potion Healing"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Health potion.png"},"col2":{"text":"28% Potent Potion","links":[{"text":"28% Potent Potion","type":"internal","page":"28% Potent Potion"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"20% Potion Healing.png"},"col2":{"text":"32% Potion","links":[{"text":"32% Potion","type":"internal","page":"32% Potion"}]}},{"col1":{"text":"Health potion.png"},"col2":{"text":"35% Potent Potion","links":[{"text":"35% Potent Potion","type":"internal","page":"35% Potent Potion"}]}}]],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Damage","last_modified":"2024-11-11T17:59:58Z","categories":["Category:Mechanics","Category:Unofficially named content"]}
