{"title":"Choose a slot","content":"The choose a slot interface is the first interface that players see after logging in through the title screen.\n\nThe first time it is opened, the agreement interface is displayed.\n\nIt gives players access to the Premium Pass, delete, settings, terms and conditions, privacy notice, and third party licenses interfaces, and allows them to choose which player character they want to play the game with.\n\nIt provides three slots, with each corresponding to a different player character. If a slot isn't attached to a player character, it can be selected to create one. A slot with a character shows its name (or \"Anonymous Player\" in case a name hasn't been selected yet), its animated avatar, its total level, when it was last played with, which faction the character is in (or \"None\" if not in a faction), and how many coins they have.\n\n\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Choose_a_slot","last_modified":"2024-11-11T05:45:12Z","categories":["Category:Incomplete articles","Category:Interface","Category:Pages with update history"]}
