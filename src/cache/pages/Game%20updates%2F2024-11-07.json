{"title":"Game updates/2024-11-07","content":"Today's update includes:\n * 1) Added more keybinds. You can see these by opening the settings interface and going to the 'controls' section. These need more work but it's a good start.\n * 2) Show a player's total level (across all professions) next to their name instead of their episode combat level. This makes it a little clearer that your levels are NOT reset or wiped when you go to a new episode! Further improvements are needed here too.\n * 3) Allow players who have a premium pass to claim their unique name from the setttings interface if they pressed 'maybe later', i.e. without requiring them to get to episode 4.\n * 4) Various other bug fixes.","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Game_updates/2024-11-07","last_modified":"2024-11-09T10:01:58Z","categories":["Category:2024 updates"]}
