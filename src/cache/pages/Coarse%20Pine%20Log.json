{"title":"Coarse Pine Log","content":"Coarse Pine Log is an item obtained from a Pine Tree using the Woodcutter profession; with a Woodcutter level of 4 and a Hatchet. It is used to make Coarse Pine Poles for the Carpenter profession by processing them with the Circular Saw then followed by refining them a second time using the Lathe found in the Carpenter's Workshop. When gathered, it yields 89 Woodcutter experience and 127 total Carpenter experience when fully processed (63 experience with the saw and a further 32*2 with the lathe). Like all other logs, each log will yield 2 poles when processed.\n\n\n\n\n * 5 logs can be obtained by salvaging them from Marden's crashed cart as part of the Forgotten Things quest, this requires no skill levels in Woodcutter or Carpenter to do so.\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Coarse_Pine_Log","last_modified":"2024-11-13T01:28:29Z","categories":["Category:Items","Category:Pages with update history"]}
