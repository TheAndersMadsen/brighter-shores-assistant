{"title":"Carpenter EXP rates","content":"Carpenter is a type of profession.\n\nThe following page lists methodologies to calculate/approximate Carpenter EXP hourly rates.\n\n\n\nThis method only applies to Ash and Juniper logs as they can only be processed once with the Circular Saw to create planks and assumes that a player already banked the logs in the Lumber Bank.\n\nThis method takes approximately ~97 seconds to perform the below steps; it takes approximately 1 hour to mill ~445.3608 logs.\n\nThe multiplier 445.3608 can be used to approximate the hourly EXP rate of Ash and Juniper logs.\n * 1) Withdraw 12 logs from the Lumber Bank\n * 2) Run over and saw the 12 logs with the Circular Saw\n * 3) Sell the planks/staves to the Timber Merchant Shop\n * 4) Run back over to the Lumber Bank\n * 5) Repeat\n\nThis method assumes that logs are already banked in the Lumber Bank This method takes approximately ~180 seconds to perform the below steps; it takes approximately 1 hour to mill ~240 logs. The multiplier 240 can be used to approximate the hourly EXP rate for carpentry.\n * 1) Withdraw 12 logs from the Lumber Bank\n * 2) Run over and saw the 12 logs with the Circular Saw\n * 3) Run over and lathe the 24 poles with the Wood Lathe\n * 4) Sell the Poles to the Timber Merchant Shop\n * 5) Run back over to the Lumber Bank\n * 6) Repeat\n\nThis method involves purchasing logs from the shop at Gwen's Lumber.\n\nThis method takes approximately ~394 seconds to perform the below steps; it takes approximately 1 hour to mill ~219.2893 logs. The multiplier 219.2893 can be used to approximate the hourly EXP rate for carpentry.\n * 1) Purchase 24 logs from Gwen's Lumber\n * 2) Bank 12 logs into the Lumber Bank\n * 3) Saw the 12 logs with the Circular Saw\n * 4) Lathe the 24 poles with the Wood Lathe\n * 5) Sell the 24 lathed Poles to the Timber Merchant Shop\n * 6) Withdraw 12 logs from the Lumber Bank\n * 7) Saw the 12 logs with the Circular Saw\n * 8) Lathe the 24 poles with the Wood Lathe\n * 9) Sell the 24 lathed Poles to the Timber Merchant Shop\n * 10) Repeat","tables":[[{"Lvl Req.":{"text":"0","number":0},"Raw
