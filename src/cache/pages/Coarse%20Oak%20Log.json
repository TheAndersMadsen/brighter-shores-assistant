{"title":"Coarse Oak Log","content":"Coarse Oak Log is an item obtained from Oak Trees using the Woodcutter profession; with a Woodcutter level of 2 and a Handsaw. It is used to make Coarse Oak Poles for the Carpenter profession by processing them with the Circular Saw then followed by refining them a second time using the Wood Lathe found in the Carpenter's Workshop. When gathered, it yields 80 Woodcutter experience and 89 total Carpenter experience when fully processed (59 experience with the saw and a further 30 with the lathe). Like all other logs, each log will yield 2 poles when processed.\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Coarse_Oak_Log","last_modified":"2024-11-13T06:17:36Z","categories":["Category:Items","Category:Pages with update history","Category:Stubs"]}
