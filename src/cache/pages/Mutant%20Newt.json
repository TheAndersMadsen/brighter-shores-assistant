{"title":"Mutant Newt","content":"Mutant Newt is a boss residing in the south-east of Hopeforest. It is encountered after boarding the fixed ferry as part of the main story quest, Nullify the corruption; although access to Hopeforest is the only requirement to access the fight. The Mutant Newt is a corrupted form of the Giant Newt must be defeated in order to cross Ferry Crossing and is part of the Nullify the corruption main story quest. Defeating the Giant Newt grants access to Ferry South Shore.\n\nDuring the boss fight, the Mutant Newt has two phases: actively damaging the ferry and idling in the water. It will start every instance of damaging the ferry with a telegraphed leap attack that will cause considerable damage to the player and a 5 second stun should they be hit by it. After the leap, the newt will proceed to damage the ferry only stopping after dealing approximately half the total hp of the structure before returning to the water and entering it's idle phase. The newt can attack from the front, port and starboard. Each side has it's own HP bar which can be damaged and repaired independently.\n\nWhen idling, this gives the player the opportunity to fix the damage caused from the previous phase. When timed correctly all damage from the previous phase can be repaired before the newt resumes it's attack with another leap.\n\n\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Mutant_Newt","last_modified":"2024-11-13T05:54:39Z","categories":["Category:Invalid profession bubble","Category:Monsters","Category:Needs aggressiveness","Category:Needs passiveness","Category:Needs variant","Category:Pages with update history","Category:Stubs"]}
