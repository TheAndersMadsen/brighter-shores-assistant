{"title":"Acidic Avenue","content":"Acidic Avenue is a room that players can enter after crafting a coated anti-acid shield during the Spider's Nest quest. Players cannot move freely in Acidic Avenue; upon entering, a cutscene shows plants spitting acid at the player, who blocks the attacks with the anti-acid shield while running to the other side. As such, the room contains 8 juniper trees that cannot be chopped down.\n\n\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Acidic_Avenue","last_modified":"2024-11-13T01:20:40Z","categories":["Category:Pages with broken file links","Category:Pages with update history","Category:Rooms","Category:Stubs"]}
