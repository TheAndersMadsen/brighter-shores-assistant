{"title":"Chopsticks Hickory Cutlery","content":"Hickory Chopsticks are the first AFK activity for the Carpentry Skill. These will persist after logout. This method is unlocked at level 20 and requires one knowledge to unlock.\n\nCrafting them requires a supply of Jars and Coarse Hickory Branches. One inventory slot of Coarse Hickory Branches will last for one hour of AFK Carpenter.\n\nYou can obtain Coarse Hickory Branches from Gwen's Lumber in Timberwell Green for 4 Silver and 200 Bronze, or trim them yourselves using the Woodcutter skill. You can sell the chopsticks back to Timberwell Supplies for a small loss.\n\n''Note - obtaining a full slot of hickory branches from Lumberjack will take one AFK hour, effectively doubling the Carpentry grind, but training both skills. An additional Knowledge and a tool purchase is required to use this Lumberjack method.''","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Chopsticks_Hickory_Cutlery","last_modified":"2024-11-13T01:26:21Z","categories":["Category:Items","Category:Needs variant"]}
