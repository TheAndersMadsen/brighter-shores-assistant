{"title":"Chef's Bounty Board","content":"Chef Bounty Board is scenery in The Delectable Dab Kitchen that can be interacted with to claim bounties to train the Chef profession. Chef Bounties are food orders from across Hopeport, which, if delivered successfully, reward money and experience. Players can only receive Chef bounties if they are level 9 in the Chef profession and the bounties will never exceed the players current Chef level. Chef bounties refresh every hour, 5 minutes past the hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Chef%27s_Bounty_Board","last_modified":"2024-11-11T10:38:12Z","categories":["Category:Pages with update history","Category:Scenery","Category:Stubs"]}
