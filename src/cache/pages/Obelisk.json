{"title":"Obelisk","content":"The Obelisk is an object used to attune weapons and armor to give them stronger stats. They can be found at every episode and when untuned gear is used on the obelisk it will tune weapons and amor to the Obelisk's respective episode. The untuned gear's level will not scale, so bringing higher level combat gear to other episodes might not always be advantageous.\n\nHopeport's Obelisk will have to be fixed first during the 'The Obelisk' quest, but others can be unlocked just by discovering them.\n\n\n\n","tables":[[{"Episode":{"text":"Hopeport episode icon.png Hopeport","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Hopeport"}]},"Location":{"text":"Hopeport Obelisk","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Hopeport Obelisk"}]}},{"Episode":{"text":"Hopeforest episode icon.png Hopeforest","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Hopeforest"}]},"Location":{"text":"Goblin Camp","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Goblin Camp"}]}},{"Episode":{"text":"Mine of Mantuban episode icon.png Mine of Mantuban","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Mine of Mantuban"}]},"Location":{"text":"Mine of Mantuban Obelisk","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Mine of Mantuban Obelisk"}]}},{"Episode":{"text":"Crenopolis episode icon.png Crenopolis","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Crenopolis"}]},"Location":{"text":"Crenobelisk","links":[{"type":"internal","page":"Crenobelisk"}]}}]],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Obelisk","last_modified":"2024-11-13T00:47:05Z","categories":["Category:Needs episode","Category:Pages with update history","Category:Scenery","Category:Stubs"]}
