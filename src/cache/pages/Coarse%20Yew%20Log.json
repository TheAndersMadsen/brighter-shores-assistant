{"title":"Coarse Yew Log","content":"Coarse Yew Log is an item obtained from a Yew Tree using the Woodcutter profession; with a Woodcutter level of 16 and a Two Person Saw. It is used to make Coarse Yew Poles for the Carpenter profession by processing them into Coarse Yew Posts with the Circular Saw then followed by refining them a second time using the Lathe found in the Carpenter's Workshop. When gathered, it yields 162 Woodcutter experience (185 xp co-op) and 168 total Carpenter experience when fully processed (84 experience with the saw and a further 42*2 with the lathe). Like all other logs, each log will yield 2 posts when processed.\n\n\n\n","tables":[],"url":"https://brightershoreswiki.org/w/Coarse_Yew_Log","last_modified":"2024-11-13T01:29:03Z","categories":["Category:Items","Category:Pages with update history"]}
